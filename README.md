# Online Platform for Grading Students' Projects

An online collaborative learning platform where users can join as either students or teachers:

**Students** can create an account, upload their projects, and have them graded not by a single authority but by a randomly selected committee of peers.
-The platform’s algorithm assigns a group of registered students to review each submission.
-Each committee member provides a grade, and the system calculates the final grade as the average of all committee evaluations.
-This process ensures fairness and encourages students to learn from each other’s perspectives.

**Teachers** have a broader view of the platform. They can:
-Access all uploaded projects.
-See which students submitted them.
-Review the grades given by the student committees.
-Monitor engagement and overall performance trends across the class.

The platform fosters a community-driven assessment environment, giving students hands-on experience in peer evaluation while allowing teachers to oversee the process and ensure academic integrity.
